Neural-Network-for-1-D-Regression
=================================
Here I have provided and example where Neural-Network is used to predict a 1-D regression model. 
This is a short description of each file:
MLPregressionLoss.m : Computes the Gradient Using Back Propogation Algorithm
MLPregressionPredict.m : Predicts the Model for the 1D Regression.
nnet.m : This is a demo showing the progress of the stochastic gradient method at every 100th iteration.
